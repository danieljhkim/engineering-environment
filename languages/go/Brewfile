# Go tooling (non-runtime)
#
# Philosophy:
# - Prefer Go version pinning via asdf in go/SETUP.md
# - Put Go *tooling* here: debugger, linters, protobuf/grpc tools

tap "homebrew/bundle"

# Protobuf / gRPC tooling (common in Go infra repos)
brew "protobuf"     # protoc compiler
brew "buf"          # protobuf lint/build tooling
brew "grpcurl"      # gRPC debugging

# Go developer tooling
brew "delve"        # dlv debugger
brew "golangci-lint" # fast multi-linter

# Optional
# brew "go"          # Only if you want Homebrew Go instead of asdf
# brew "gofumpt"     # Stricter gofmt (can also be installed via 'go install')
# brew "mockery"     # Mocks generator (often installed via 'go install')
# brew "k6"          # Load testing (handy for services)
